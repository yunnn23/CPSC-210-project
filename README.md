# Movie List Application

A movie List application. Users can make a watchlist of movies that they have not seen yet. 
If they watch a movie from the watchlist, the movie will be added to the watched movie list.
They also can rate the movie after they watched a movie.
It would be useful for users who are interested in movies and want to record movies they have seen so that
they can keep track of the movies watched. 
Also, they can make a watchlist of movies that they want to see in the future.
As I am a movie fan, I always thought it would be nice to have a tracking list of movies for oneâ€™s record.

# Phase 4: Task 3
If I had more time to work on the project, I would refactor my MovieListGUI class in the ui package.
There are 4 inner classes in the MovieListGui class, which seems to be a little messy and complicated.
I would take these 4 classes out from this class and create them as a single class in the ui package.
By refactoring the MovieListGui class, my design could be improved, making the GUI class be tidy and easy to understand.
In addition, I would create a method that helps make an ImageIcon, which can avoid duplicating some codes.
